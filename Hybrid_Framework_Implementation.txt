STEPS TO DEVELOPE FRAMEWORK
----------------------------
1. Create Maven Project
2. Update pom.xml
3. Craete Page Objects
4. Create Basic Test Case
5. Add Logs to Test Case
6. Read common values from properties file
7. Run Test case on desired browser
8. Add extent Report
9. Create Data Driven Test case
10. Adding new Test case
================================

1. Run Test Cases Using Pom.xml File (Within Eclipse)
-----------------------------------------------------
   A. If you want to execute test cases using pom.xml file, We have to Approaches like using dependencies and using Plugins
   B. Plugins are Two types like "Compiler" and "Surefire" plugins
   C. In pom.xml file you need to add two plugins like Compiler and Surefire plugins
   D. Next Update Your testng.xml file in Surefire Plugin
   E. Next Run pom.xml file, Just Right click on pom.xml file Run as => First Check "Maven Clean" and Check "Maven Test"
     
        Note:- While Running this you will get one Error like => No Compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you running on a Jre rather than Jdk?
               Once you will get this Error, You have to update your jdk 
       
        Follow this link will show you exact solution => http://roufid.com/no-compiler-is-provided-in-this-environment/
        
   F. So, Finally The BUILD SUCCESS

2. Run Test cases through Maven CLI(Command Line Interface) With out Eclipse
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
     A. If you want to run test cases through CMD Prompt, you should install Maven in your Local Machine
     B. Go to Your Project Location in CMD Prompt
   
            => cd E:\Praveen_Automation\TCS_SELENIUM\HybridFramework  
   
            => cd dir (Press enter will shows all project files in cmd prompt like testng.xml, pom.xml------)

     C. Next Run Maven Commands like, Type the Following Commands

         => mvn clean install (Click Enter)

          It will start the Execution like Shows us "T E S T S" and Finally Shows "BUILD SUCCESS"

3. Run Test cases through run.bat
--------------------------------
   
   A. If you want to Run Test cases through bat file, you need to Create one Bat file in your project
   B. Next Edit your Bat file and send to your project location and mvn command. Follow below 

       cd E:\Praveen_Automation\TCS_SELENIUM\HybridFramework
       mvn clean install

   C. Once type the above commands and save and close
   D. Run the Bat file(double click), it will start the execution in CMD Prompt 
   E. So, Finally BUILD SUCCESS

4. Run Test cases through Jenkins
----------------------------------

   A. If you want to run Test cases through Jenkins, you must have to download jenkins war file from google
        
        https://jenkins.io/download/
   B. After downloading jekins war file, go to your exact jenkins war file and open CMD Prompt and run following command

   C. java -jar jenkins.war (Press Enter), Finally will shows us Jekins is Fully up and running
  
   D. Then go to browser enter the url like "localhost:8080", it will ask for username and password. Next Login it will shows us Jenkins dashboard
    
   E. We will Run our  Project in Two ways like

          =>  Execute Project using Free style project(using run.bat file)
          =>  Execute Project using Maven(Using pom.xml)
           
       Execute Project using Free style project(using run.bat file)
     
            a. First yiu have to create one new item using Freestyle 
            b. Then after write some description, then after in Build Drop down select "Execute windows batch command", it will open Box, 
               then after send your project location along with bat file, then follow below 

               cd E:\Praveen_Automation\TCS_SELENIUM\HybridFramework
               run.bat

              Then finally Apply and save. It will Open Dahboard
